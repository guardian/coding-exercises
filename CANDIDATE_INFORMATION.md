# Candidate Information

Thank you for applying to the Guardian.

Please take some time to go over the [README](./README.md) prior to your interview.
It provides in depth information about this stage: why we perform it, what we’re trying to assess and how.

As an overview, you’ll spend 60 minutes with a software engineer, 
working through **one** of the exercises in this repository. 
You will be writing a program that can be run from the command line. You will also have the opportunity to ask the interviewer questions about the interview process, the role, the company, etc.

Your interviewer will tell you which exercise you’ll be working on at the start of the interview.

## Remote Interviews
We conduct remote interviews over [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).
Google Meet is a video conferencing tool that supports screen sharing.
Google Meet is supported by the major browsers. Full requirements can be found [here](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7317473?hl=en-GB).

A link will be included on your interview invitation, click it to join.
Once joined, your interviewer will ask you to share your screen.

> **Note**
> - Turning on your camera is optional.
> - We do not assess your IDE setup.
> - We currently do not allow the use of GitHub Copilot and similar tools.

### Before the interview
**Please have your coding environment set up before the interview starts.**

This is to ensure we maximise the time we have for you to demonstrate your skills.

We have a few [starter projects](https://github.com/guardian/coding-exercise-project) that you can use or you can set up an empty project from scratch.

### After the interview
At the end of your interview, you’ll be asked to share your solution with your interviewer for later reference,
ideally as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

This will not be shared outside of the hiring group. 

Thank you and good luck!
